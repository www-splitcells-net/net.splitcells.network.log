# Splitcells Network Log
This project contains relevant logs for the project cluster Splitcells Network.

It is mainly a data repository, in order to not bloat the main repository.
Currently, the focus is on performance data,
in order to check and document the software's performance.

A database like Prometheus is not used in order to have a simple and portable
data.
This also makes it easy to render the data for a static website.
Keep in mind, that this data can be imported into i.e. Prometheus,
if a need for complex or adaptiv visualization is present.
